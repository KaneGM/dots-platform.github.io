Google’s Private Join and Compute service is a new type of MPC that augments the core Private Set Intersection (PSI) protocol to allow organizations to collaborate with their confidential data sets. In particular, Private Join and Compute combines PSI and homomorphic encryption to privately compute the sum of associated values for records that have common identifiers in each of two users’ datasets.
