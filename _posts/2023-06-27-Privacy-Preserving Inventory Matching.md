Inventory matching is a mechanism for trading financial stocks in which buyers and sellers are paired. In the centralized setting, parties must share their order to buy or sell a stock, accompanied by the quantity. This is sensitive information that could cause adverse price movements prematurely, swaying prices adversely before a transaction finalizes. Prime Match allows clients to match their orders with reduced market impact while maintaining privacy through MPC. Prime Match runs in production at J.P Morgan, a large U.S. bank.
