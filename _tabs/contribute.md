{: .prompt-tip }

To add a new MPC deployment, you simply need to create a PR with a new Markdown file.
1. Navigate to the `/_posts/` directory.
2. Add yourself as an author in `/_data/authors.yml` ([here](https://github.com/dots-platform/dots-platform.github.io/blob/master/_data/authors.yml)). The first element will be your author ID and the first link will be where on the web people can find you.
2. Copy the `YYYY-MM-DD-Title.md` template file ([here](https://github.com/dots-platform/dots-platform.github.io/blob/master/_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-Title.md)).
3. Fill in details about the deployment. Details above the `---` and the description are required; other headers are suggestions. For examples of what text and typography is supported, see these [template](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/text-and-typography/) [resources](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/blob/master/_posts/2019-08-08-text-and-typography.md).
4. Submit the PR with a description of the change to the ([repo](https://github.com/dots-platform/dots-platform.github.io)). To help us out, please [confirm locally](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/getting-started/#running-local-server) that your version renders.
5. We will review it, suggest any changes, and hopefully merge your update!

> **Note:** The MPC Deployment Dashboard only includes applications that have been deployed and reached a substantial number of users in practice.
